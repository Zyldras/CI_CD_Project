# CI_CD_Project : To do list


## Subject

You have to answer as best as you can the following user needs: "I am a developer and I care a lot about good code patterns. Unfortunately, there is plenty of sites and explanations about those patterns. I would like to have a site where I can put the patterns with a code sample and when to use it. A web app would be fine!"

You will need to practice every part of the course to develop a solution for this user and deliver it. You can use the technology you want except an already-developed solution of course.

You will not have time to put into practice the best-in-class solution, so you have to deal with the time you have to make the best you can, like in your professional life. Explains why you decide to do or not do something.

What are the expected submissions?

- The web application must be publicly accessible and work without bugs.
- The code must be pushed on GitHub on a repository. This repository must be public or must be shared with the user emmanuelgautier.
- Explanations in the README or any other relevant files why the code is structured as it is and the other tech choices made.
